# visualize_coauthor_network
These are just some (somawhat) simple scripts I've used to visualize my coauthor network using google scholar over the years (i.e., for promotion and tenure packets). The following figures are the (post-processed in illustrator) figure from my P&T packet to Assco. Prof. and the second is the figure from the most recent script (wokring on makingit noce now).
