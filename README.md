# visualize_coauthor_network
These are just some (somawhat) simple scripts I've used to visualize my coauthor network using google scholar over the years (i.e., for promotion and tenure packets). The following figures are the (post-processed in illustrator) figure from my P&T packet to Assoc. Prof. and the second is the figure (minimally post-processed, i.e., fiont sizes and the white halo added) from the most recent script ("_v2" - I'm wokring on making it nice now...).
